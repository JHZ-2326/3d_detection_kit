# 3D Detection Kit

This repo contains several useful scripts which using for 3D detection algorithm development. Including:

- Loading and visualization on lidar point cloud;
- Generate bev map(bird view map);
- Showing 3D Bounding box on point cloud;
- Project 3D Bounding Box on image with calib params;
- Showing bbox on bev image angle;



## Usage

directly using:

```
python3 show_pc.py
```

and you can see point cloud. you should also install *open3d* first, using:

```
